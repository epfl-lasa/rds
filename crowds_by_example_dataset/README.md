This database was used as an _example database_ to synthesize simulated crowds with a natural-looking behavior. It was manually assembled from overhead shot videos of a real crowd in motion. It provides examples of static geometries and associated trajectories of individuals, to allow computing of a simulation based on real-world crowd interaction data.
